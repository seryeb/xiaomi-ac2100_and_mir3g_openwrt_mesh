# Latest OpenWrt image for [Xiaomi Redmi AC2100](https://xiaomi-mi.com/wifi-routers/redmi-ac2100-router/) and [Xiaomi Mi router 3g v1](https://openwrt.org/toh/xiaomi/mir3g) with 802.11s enabled

This GitHub action is to build fresh images of latest OpenWrt snapshot using imagebuilder so I can automatically update my routers at home. 

As I have 4 routers with different roles, I generate an image for each kind.

What is common to all images:
 * add TCP BBR
 * removed all PPP packages
 * add luci
 * add 802.11s for mesh
 * add iperf3, mtr, iwinfo, libustream-wolfssl and ca-bundle

What is specific to type1:
* add wireguard (and luci-app-wireguard)
* add nextdns (and luci-app-nextdns)

What is specific to type2:
* add frps (and luci-app-frps)
* add shadowsocks-libev server (and luci-app-shadowsocks)
* add ttyd (and luci-app-ttyd)
* removed dnsmasq and odhcpd

What is specific to type3:
* removed dnsmasq and odhcpd

How do I use each image ?
* type1 is deployed on my router connected to internet.
* type2 is deployed on my router wired to type1, where I run frps, ttyd and shadowsocks.
* type3 is deployed on my router meshed to type1, and I only use it to extend my wifi network.

Feel free to use the image or the github action by forking it.
